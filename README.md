The R script run_analysis.R does the following:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repository contains:
- README.md, provides an overview of assignment and contents of repository.
- tidy_data.txt, the data set created through the script.
- CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the variables in the tidy dateset.
- run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set.
